# Stable IPC

Existing ADS IPC endpoints remain available.

## Endpoints

- `ADS.StartDutyFromOutside() -> bool`
- `ADS.StartDutyFromInside() -> bool`
- `ADS.ResumeDutyFromInside() -> bool`
- `ADS.LeaveDuty() -> bool`
- `ADS.GetCapabilitiesJson() -> string`
- `ADS.Invoke(string action, string payloadJson) -> string`
- `ADS.GetConfigurationJson() -> string`
- `ADS.PatchConfigurationJson(string patchJson) -> string`
- `ADS.StartExtractMateria() -> bool`
- `ADS.GetExtractMateriaStatusJson() -> string`
- `ADS.StartDesynth(string mode) -> bool`
- `ADS.StartShopPurchase(uint itemId, int quantity) -> bool`
- `ADS.SetShopKeepOpen(bool enabled) -> bool`
- `ADS.GetShopPurchaseStatusJson() -> string`
- `ADS.CancelUtility() -> bool`
- `ADS.OpenDesynthConfigUi() -> bool`
- `ADS.IsDutyOwned() -> bool`
- `ADS.GetDesynthStatusJson() -> string`

`ADS.StartDutyFromOutside` and `ADS.StartDutyFromInside` share the same start methods as ADS chat, UI, and operator actions. They best-effort-send `/xldisableplugin AutoDuty` before ownership work; a dispatch failure is logged and the start still proceeds. `ADS.ResumeDutyFromInside` does not disable AutoDuty.

`ADS.IsDutyOwned` is authoritative runtime duty ownership. It returns `true` only while live instanced-duty truth is active and ADS mode is `OwnedStartOutside`, `OwnedStartInside`, `OwnedResumeInside`, or `Leaving`. It returns `false` for `Idle`, `Observing`, `Failed`, and queued outside-duty ownership.

`ADS.StartDesynth` accepts legacy modes `configured`, `all`, `whitelist`, `last-duty`, and `skillups`, plus direct source-scope aliases `inventory-only`, `everywhere-skip-gearsets`, and `everywhere`.

`ADS.StartExtractMateria` starts existing no-configuration materia extraction and returns whether the start was accepted. `/ads extractmateria` remains unchanged.

`ADS.StartShopPurchase` accepts a positive decimal `uint` item ID and a quantity from `1` through `9999`. `true` means ADS accepted the run; it does not mean the purchase completed. Quantity is the exact number of additional item units. `ADS.CancelUtility` cancels an active purchase and preserves verified partial acquisition truth.

`ADS.SetShopKeepOpen` toggles shop reuse across consecutive purchases and returns the value now in effect. While on, a SUCCESSFUL purchase leaves its shop open so the next purchase from the same shop skips navigate/interact/open; a failed run still tears the UI down. Calling it with `false` ends the chain AND closes whatever was left standing — that is the supported way to finish, because `ADS.CancelUtility` cannot close a held shop: every cancel path early-returns unless a purchase is still running, and a held shop only exists once the purchase is terminal.

Turning it on is what makes a multi-item run from one vendor work at all: each close-and-re-interact cycle leaves the character in an unfinished NPC event, the game tolerates one such stale event but not two, and the THIRD consecutive interact with the same NPC is silently ignored (measured over 50 fleet restock runs: 6/6 succeeded with two sessions, 44/44 failed on the third).

The generic equivalent is:

```text
ADS.Invoke("utility.start-shop-purchase", "{\"itemId\":38420,\"quantity\":3}")
```

The action is additive and capability schema version remains `1`.

`ADS.GetExtractMateriaStatusJson` returns extraction-specific state:

```json
{"running":false,"done":true,"succeeded":true,"status":"Materia extraction finished.","success":"Materia extraction finished.","failure":"","completedAtUtc":"2026-06-10T12:34:56.7890000Z"}
```

- `done` becomes `true` only after an accepted extraction reaches success, failure, or cancellation.
- `succeeded` is `null` before completion, then `true` or `false`.
- Rejected starts and unrelated utility runs do not overwrite the last accepted extraction result.

`ADS.GetShopPurchaseStatusJson` returns purchase-specific state. Offer currency amounts are totals required for the request and the amount available when offers were evaluated.

```json
{
  "running": false,
  "done": true,
  "succeeded": true,
  "phase": "completed",
  "itemId": 38420,
  "itemName": "Manderium Meteorite",
  "requestedQuantity": 3,
  "acquiredQuantity": 3,
  "remainingQuantity": 0,
  "selectedOffer": {
    "shopKind": "special-shop-tomestone",
    "shopId": 1770624,
    "shopName": "Manderville Weapon Materials Exchange",
    "row": 0,
    "npcId": 1043892,
    "npcName": "Jubrunnah",
    "territoryId": 963,
    "territoryName": "Radz-at-Han",
    "receiveCount": 1,
    "currencies": [
      {
        "kind": "tomestone",
        "itemId": 28,
        "name": "Allagan Tomestones of Poetics",
        "requiredAmount": 1500,
        "availableAmount": 2000,
        "availabilityKnown": true
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "itemId": 38420,
        "name": "Manderium Meteorite",
        "countPerTransaction": 1
      }
    ],
    "availabilityKnown": true
  },
  "alternativeOffers": [],
  "failureCode": null,
  "statusMessage": "Purchased exactly 3 additional Manderium Meteorite.",
  "successMessage": "Purchased exactly 3 additional Manderium Meteorite.",
  "failureMessage": "",
  "lastStartError": "",
  "completedAtUtc": "2026-07-14T12:34:56.7890000Z"
}
```

The additive `shopKind` values are `special-shop-mixed`, `inclusion-shop`, `grand-company-shop`, and `free-company-shop`. Additive currency kinds include `company-seal`, `mgp`, `wolf-mark`, `allied-seal`, `currency-manager`, and `free-company-credit`. `outputs` describes every deterministic output per transaction. `availabilityKnown` is false when a sheet gate or balance must be proven in the live shop, such as Free Company credits.

The stable failure-code vocabulary is `invalid-request`, `busy`, `unsupported-offer`, `no-route`, `insufficient-currency`, `ambiguous-currency`, `missing-dependency`, `inventory-capacity`, `ui-mismatch`, `timeout`, and `cancelled`. Accepted runs place an applicable terminal code in `failureCode`. Rejected starts preserve the prior `failureCode` and update only `lastStartError`; they do not replace the last accepted purchase result. Unrelated utility runs also leave that result intact. Capability schema version remains `1`.

Capability schema version is `1`. `ADS.Invoke` returns:

```json
{"success":true,"action":"utility.start-desynth","message":"Accepted.","data":null}
```

Unknown actions/settings, invalid payloads/modes, and invalid presets fail without mutation. Stable actions cover duty/window/utility operations, presets, ledger clear, and configuration patching. `utility.start-extract-materia` starts extraction without a payload.

Preferred desynthesis setting:

- `desynthInventoryScope`: `InventoryOnly`, `InventoryAndArmourySkipGearsets`, or `InventoryAndArmoury`.

Deprecated compatibility inputs:

- `desynthCategories`: accepted as raw legacy salvage category names, then normalized to `desynthInventoryScope`.
- `desynthProtectGearsets`: accepted as legacy input, then folded into `desynthInventoryScope`.
